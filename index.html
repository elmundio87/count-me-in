<h1>Count Me In</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
Count Me In is the best way to distribute an RSVP to events, and keep your guests updated with the latest information about your wedding, party or night out!

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
Once you've set up an event, you will be provided with a barcode that you can attach to your invitations.

Simply direct your users to download Count Me In from the App Store, and they can RSVP once they have scanned the barcode. It's simple!

<h2>How do I set up an event?</h2>
Using a web app like Google Forms, set up the questions that you want your guests to respond to.

<a href="mailto:events@elmund.io">Send an email</a> containing the following information
<ol>
  <li>Your event name</li>
  <li>A link to the RSVP form</li>
  <li>A picture of the area around the venue (preferably a map)</li>
  <li>A google map link containing the latitude and longitude of the venue</li>
  <li>The venue name and website</li>
  <li>Any additional information about the event</li>
</ol>

Once your event is set up, you will receive an email containing your invitation code and barcode and a password. Do not reveal the password to your guests.
